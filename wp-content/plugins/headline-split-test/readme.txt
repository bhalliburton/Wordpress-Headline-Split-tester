This plug-in allows you to enter an alternate headline for every post on your blog.  The headlines are then randomly alternated on your website until a certain number of "headline views" has been reached.  At that point, a "winning" headline (as determined by the number of people that have clicked on each headline to date) is determined and that headline is shown going forward.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it test for statistical significance? =

We track how many times headlines are shown and how many times each headline is clicked.  When a headline has been shown enough, the headline with the most clicks wins.

= That sucks! =

Yeah, but it is better than some alternatives. Feel free to submit patches.
